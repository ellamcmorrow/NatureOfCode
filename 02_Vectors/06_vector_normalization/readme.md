# 05_vector_normalization
Normalization is making a vector unit </br>
When we normalize an object we give it a length = 1 .</br>
You then multiply it by how much you want that one unit to be equal to.</br>
In this case we multiply by fifty. </br>
The line remains at this length- doesn't change.</br>

```js

vectorLine.normalize(); //keeps it standard, turns into a unit vector
vectorLine.mult(50); //constant length of 50 = 1unit

```
